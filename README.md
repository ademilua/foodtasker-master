- TO MAKE IT WORK

Clone the repo and create a virtual environment

<pre> python -m venv myenv </pre>

cd myenv

and cd Scripts

inside the Scripts activate the virtual environment with
 
<pre> activate.bat </pre>

run the server with 

<pre> python manage.py runserver </pre>


Incase the server did not load up, install the necessary missing modules as shown after the runserver command has been executed.
